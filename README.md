## What is SYCL?

If you're not familiar with SYCL or would like some further resources for
learning about SYCL below are a list of useful resources:

*  Read a description of SYCL on the [Khronos website SYCL page](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/).
*  Go to the Khronos website to find [a list of SYCL resources](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/resources).
*  Check out the [SYCL 1.2.1 reference guide](https://www.khronos.org/files/sycl/sycl-12-reference-card.pdf).
*  Browse SYCL news, blog posts, videos, projects and more on the [sycl.tech community website](https://sycl.tech/)
*  Get a list of the [available SYCL implementations](https://sycl.tech/#get-sycl)

### How to use the Materials

The exercises can be found in "Code_Exercises" in the sub-directory for each
topic. Each exercise has a markdown document instructing what to do in the
exercise, a source file to start with and a solution file to provide an
example implementation to compare against.

#### Installing ComputeCpp

To set up ComputeCpp download the [ComputeCpp CE package][computecpp-download]
